# How to Get More Customers for Your Field Service Business (Without Spending on Ads)

Everyone says "run Facebook ads" or "buy Google ads." But what if you're bootstrapping and can't afford to burn $1,000/month figuring out ads?

Here are the strategies that actually got me customers when I was starting out.

## 1. Google Business Profile (Formerly Google My Business)

**Why it matters:** When someone googles "plumber near me," you want to be in that map pack.

**What to do:**
- Claim your Google Business Profile (it's free)
- Add photos of your work (at least 20)
- Get reviews (more on this below)
- Post weekly updates
- Answer all questions

**Real numbers:** I went from 2-3 calls/week to 12-15 calls/week just by optimizing my profile. Zero ad spend.

**Time investment:** 30 minutes to set up, 15 minutes/week to maintain

## 2. The Review Machine

Reviews are the cheat code for field service businesses. Here's my exact system:

**Immediately After the Job:**
1. Ask in person: "If you're happy with the work, would you mind leaving a quick review?"
2. Text them a direct link to your Google review page
3. Follow up 24 hours later if they haven't left one

**Pro tip:** People are 10x more likely to leave a review if you ask in person and immediately send the link.

**My conversion rate:**
- Ask in person only: 20% leave reviews
- Ask + send link: 65% leave reviews
- Don't ask: 5% leave reviews

**Tools I use:**
- [Job Flow Hub](https://creativejobhub.com) automatically sends the review link after I mark the job complete
- You can also use a simple text template saved in your phone

## 3. Partner with Real Estate Agents

This one is money. Real estate agents need reliable contractors constantly.

**How to do it:**
1. Make a list of 20 real estate agents in your area
2. Send them a simple email or LinkedIn message
3. Offer a "real estate agent discount" (10-15% off)
4. Actually show up and do good work
5. Ask them to refer you to their network

**My email template:**

```
Subject: Reliable [Your Trade] for Your Clients

Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], a licensed [trade] in [area]. I work with several 
real estate agents who need reliable contractors for their clients' 
home repairs and inspections.

I offer a 15% discount for all real estate agent referrals and 
priority scheduling.

Would you be open to a quick call to discuss how I can help your clients?

[Your Name]
[Phone]
[Website]
```

**Results:** One good real estate agent can send you 2-5 jobs per month.

## 4. Door Hangers in Nice Neighborhoods

Old school but it works. Here's the strategy:

**What to do:**
- Print simple door hangers (Vistaprint, ~$50 for 500)
- Target neighborhoods where you've done work
- Include a before/after photo
- Offer a "neighbor discount"

**My door hanger includes:**
- Photo of recent work in the area
- "Your neighbor at [address] used our services"
- Special offer (10% off or free estimate)
- Clear phone number

**Results:** 1-2 calls per 100 hangers. Cost: ~$0.10 per hanger.

**ROI:** If one call turns into a $500 job, you made $450 profit from $10 in door hangers.

## 5. Local Facebook Groups

Not ads - I'm talking about community groups.

**Strategy:**
1. Join local "buy/sell/trade" and "community" Facebook groups
2. Become helpful (not spammy)
3. Answer questions related to your trade
4. Occasionally mention your business when relevant

**Example:**
Someone posts: "Does anyone know a good electrician?"

Your response: "I'm a licensed electrician in [area]. I can come give you a free estimate. Here's my number: [phone]. I've helped several people in this group - happy to share references!"

**Results:** 2-5 leads per month from being active in 5-10 local groups.

**Key:** Don't be spammy. Actually help people. Build trust.

## 6. Yard Signs (When You're Working)

Every job site is a billboard. Use it.

**What to do:**
- Get professional yard signs made (~$50 each)
- Put them out every single job
- Include: Your business name, phone number, trade, "Ask me about the [neighbor discount/free estimate]"

**Why it works:** People see you working and think "I should get that fixed too."

**Real story:** I got a $3,500 deck refinishing job because a neighbor saw my sign while I was working on another deck.

**Tip:** Ask the homeowner permission first. Most say yes.

## 7. The "Next Door Discount"

This is my secret weapon.

**How it works:**
1. You're working on a job
2. Knock on 5-10 doors nearby
3. Quick intro: "Hi, I'm [name]. I'm working on your neighbor's [project]. I'm offering the neighbors a 15% discount if you need any [your trade] work done this week."
4. Leave a card

**Script:**
"Hey, I'm Jeremy. I'm working on your neighbor's plumbing at [address]. While I'm in the area this week, I'm offering neighbors 15% off any plumbing work. Do you have anything that needs looking at?"

**Results:** 1 in 10 neighbors will have something. That's an extra job from knocking on 10 doors.

## The Strategy That Combines All of This

Here's what I do on every job now:

**Before the job:**
- Post about it on local Facebook groups

**During the job:**
- Put up yard signs
- Knock on nearby doors
- Take before/after photos

**After the job:**
- Ask for a review (in person + text link)
- Ask for referrals
- Add photos to Google Business Profile
- Drop door hangers in the neighborhood

**Time investment:** Extra 30 minutes per job
**Result:** 1-2 additional leads per job

## Track What Works

Don't guess. Track your lead sources.

**Ask every caller:** "How did you hear about us?"

**My simple tracking:**
- Google Business Profile: 40% of leads
- Referrals: 25% of leads
- Door hangers/yard signs: 20% of leads
- Facebook groups: 10% of leads
- Real estate agents: 5% of leads

This tells me where to focus my time.

**Pro tip:** [Job Flow Hub](https://creativejobhub.com) tracks lead sources automatically when you create new customers.
