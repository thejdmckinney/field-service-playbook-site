# How to Scale Your Field Service Business from $100K to $500K (Real Numbers)

I took my handyman business from $80K/year (just me) to $520K/year in 3 years.

Here's exactly how I did it, what worked, what didn't, and the numbers behind each decision.

---

## The Reality Check

Most field service owners get stuck at $100-150K because they hit a wall: **their own time.**

**The math:**
- 40 billable hours/week × 48 weeks = 1,920 hours/year
- At $75/hour = $144,000/year (before expenses)
- Take home maybe $80-100K after expenses

**You can't scale yourself.** You need to scale systems and people.

---

## Phase 1: Solo to $150K (Year 1)

**Goal:** Max out your personal capacity while building systems

### What I Did:

**1. Raised prices by 25%**
- $60/hour → $75/hour
- Lost 2 customers
- Made $15/hour more on everyone else

**Revenue impact:** +$28,800/year

**2. Specialized (sort of)**
- Stopped doing everything
- Focused on decks, fences, and light carpentry
- Said no to plumbing and electrical

**Result:** Faster work, better reputation, higher prices

**3. Built basic systems**
- Text templates for common responses
- Standard estimate format
- Simple scheduling in Google Calendar

**Time saved:** 5-7 hours/week = more billable hours

**4. Got serious about marketing**
- Google Business Profile optimized
- Asked for reviews consistently
- Door hangers in neighborhoods where I worked

**Result:** Never ran out of work

**Year 1 Numbers:**
- Revenue: $144,000
- Take home: ~$95,000
- Hours worked: 50-60/week

---

## Phase 2: First Hire - $150K to $250K (Year 2)

**Goal:** Clone yourself (kind of)

### The Big Decision: Hiring

This was terrifying. I was making $95K and comfortable. Hiring meant risk.

**The math that convinced me:**

If I hire someone at $20/hour and bill them at $60/hour:
- Their cost: $20/hour
- Payroll taxes/insurance: ~$5/hour
- Total cost: $25/hour
- Revenue: $60/hour
- Profit: $35/hour
- At 30 billable hours/week = $54,600 profit/year

**Even if they're only 50% as efficient, I still profit $27K.**

### How I Found My First Employee:

**Where I looked:**
- Craigslist (actually worked)
- Local trade schools
- Asked my best customers if they knew anyone

**Red flags I watched for:**
- Shows up late to interview
- Can't explain previous experience clearly
- Gives vague answers
- Bad mouths previous employers

**What I actually hired for:**
- Shows up on time
- Has basic skills (I can train the rest)
- Good attitude
- Reliable vehicle
- Clean driving record

### The First 90 Days:

**Week 1-2: Shadow me**
- They came on every job
- Learned my standards
- Learned how I talk to customers
- Learned my systems

**Week 3-4: Helper**
- Started doing parts of jobs
- I supervised everything
- Corrected mistakes immediately

**Week 5-8: Junior tech**
- Started doing small jobs alone
- I checked their work
- Still came with me on big jobs

**Week 9-12: Independent**
- Could handle most standard jobs
- Knew when to call me
- Trusted with customers

**Real talk:** They screwed up a few times. I ate the cost, fixed it, trained better.

### Systems I Built:

**1. Job completion checklist**
- Prevents forgotten steps
- Ensures quality
- Easy to follow

**2. Photo requirements**
- Before/after photos on every job
- Proves work was done right
- Great for marketing

**3. Customer communication**
- Sent from company number (not personal)
- Standard templates
- Professional tone

**4. Daily check-ins**
- Morning: Here's your schedule
- Evening: How did it go? Any issues?

**Year 2 Numbers:**
- Revenue: $248,000
- My billable hours: 35/week (down from 50)
- Employee billable hours: 30/week
- Take home: ~$125,000

---

## Phase 3: Systematize Everything - $250K to $350K (Year 3)

**Goal:** Remove myself from day-to-day operations

### The Breakthrough:

I realized I was the bottleneck. Every decision went through me.

**What had to change:**
- Estimates (I was doing them all)
- Scheduling (I was managing the calendar)
- Customer service (they called me for everything)
- Quality control (I checked everything)

### Systems I Implemented:

**1. Standard pricing book**
- Common jobs have set prices
- Employee can quote without me
- No more $500 decks because they didn't know better

**Example:**
- Deck refinishing: $X per sq ft
- Fence repair: $X per linear foot
- Door installation: $X per door

**2. Tiered scheduling**
- Employee handles standard jobs
- I handle complex jobs and estimates
- Emergency buffer time in schedule

**3. Customer service number**
- Google Voice number (free)
- Both employee and I get messages
- Professional separation

**4. Software (finally)**
- Switched from Google Calendar to [Job Flow Hub](https://creativejobhub.com)
- Scheduling, invoicing, customer tracking in one place
- Employee has the app, I can see everything

**Time saved:** 15-20 hours/week

### Second Hire:

Made the same mistake everyone makes: **hired too late.**

Should have hired when revenue hit $220K. Waited until $280K and was drowning.

**Lesson:** Hire when you're at 80% capacity, not 120%.

**Year 3 Numbers:**
- Revenue: $364,000
- My billable hours: 25/week
- 2 employees at 32 hours/week each
- Take home: ~$145,000

---

## Phase 4: Real Business - $350K to $500K (Year 4)

**Goal:** Build a business that doesn't require me in the field

### The Pivot:

I stopped being a technician and became a business owner.

**My new job:**
- Sales & estimates
- Quality control
- Marketing & growth
- Team management
- Systems improvement

**Time in field:** 5-10 hours/week (only big/complex jobs)

### What Changed:

**1. Professional branding**
- Wrapped truck ($3K)
- Professional logo & website ($2K)
- Uniformed employees
- Branded yard signs

**ROI:** Looked bigger than we were, got bigger jobs

**2. Specialized for real**
- Only decks, fences, and outdoor structures
- Turned down everything else
- Raised prices again

**3. Lead management system**
- Tracked every lead source
- Calculated cost per lead
- Doubled down on what worked

**Sources:**
- Google Business Profile: 45% of leads
- Referrals: 30% of leads
- Door hangers/yard signs: 15% of leads
- Other: 10%

**4. Third hire (office/scheduling)**
- Part-time (20 hours/week)
- Answers calls
- Schedules jobs
- Handles basic customer service

**Cost:** $15/hour × 20 hours = $300/week
**Value:** I got 20 hours/week back

### The Numbers That Mattered:

**Revenue per employee:**
- Target: $125K/employee
- Actual: $130K/employee

**Profit margin:**
- Year 1: 55% (just me)
- Year 4: 32% (with team)
- But $165K > $95K

**Year 4 Numbers:**
- Revenue: $520,000
- 2 full-time techs + 1 part-time admin
- My billable hours: 8-10/week
- Take home: ~$165,000

## What Didn't Work

**1. General marketing/ads**

- Fire fast if someone doesn't care

**3. Management**
- I hated managing at first
