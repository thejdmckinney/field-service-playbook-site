# 5 Ways to Increase Revenue in Your Handyman Business

After running Creative Constructors for years and working 12+ hour days, I learned that working harder doesn't always mean earning more. Here's what actually moves the needle...

## 1. Raise Your Prices (Seriously)

Most handymen undercharge. I was guilty of this for years. Here's the truth: if you're booked solid, you're too cheap.

**What I did:**
- Increased my hourly rate by 25%
- Lost zero clients
- Made 25% more revenue working the same hours

The math is simple. Would you rather do 10 jobs at $100 each or 8 jobs at $125 each? Same money, less work, more time to find better clients.

## 2. Create Service Packages

Stop quoting hourly. Create packages instead.

**Example packages I use:**
- **Home Refresh Package** - $899 (Minor repairs, paint touch-ups, caulking, door adjustments)
- **Rental Turnover Package** - $1,499 (Everything needed to get a rental ready)
- **Seasonal Maintenance** - $299/quarter (Preventive maintenance checklist)

Clients love predictable pricing. You love predictable revenue.

## 3. Focus on High-End Neighborhoods

This changed everything for me. I shifted from scattered jobs across DFW to focusing on University Park and Highland Park.

**Why it works:**
- Higher property values = higher budgets
- Clients value quality over lowest price
- More referrals to similar clients
- Less price shopping

## 4. Upsell Maintenance Plans

This is where MetroPlex Shield came from. Instead of one-time jobs, offer ongoing relationships.

**My approach:**
- Offer maintenance plan at end of every job
- Show them what breaks when ignored
- Lock in monthly recurring revenue
- You become their "go-to guy"

I converted 30% of one-time clients to maintenance plans. That's predictable income every month.

## 5. Use Actually Good Software

I wasted $10,000+ on Jobber and Housecall Pro before I built Creative Job Hub. Here's why software matters for revenue:

- **Stop losing estimates** - Track every quote, follow up automatically
- **Invoice faster** - Get paid faster
- **Look professional** - Online booking, automated reminders
- **Work less on admin** - More time for billable work

The right tools don't cost money - they make you money.

## The Bottom Line

You don't need to work longer hours. You need to work smarter. Raise prices, package services, focus on better clients, create recurring revenue, and use tools that actually help.
