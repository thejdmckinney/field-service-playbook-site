# How to Deliver 5-Star Customer Service in Field Service (And Actually Mean It)

Most field service businesses think customer service means "doing good work."

Doing good work is the bare minimum. 

Here's what actually gets you 5-star reviews and loyal customers.

---

## The Hard Truth

Your competition does good work too. You're not special.

**What makes you memorable:**
- Communication
- Reliability
- Making customers feel valued
- Fixing problems fast

Everything else is just doing your job.

## The 5-Star Customer Service System

This is my exact system. It works for plumbing, electrical, HVAC, handyman, landscaping - any field service.

### Phase 1: Before the Job

**First contact (within 1 hour):**

When someone reaches out, respond fast. Every hour you wait, they're calling your competition.

**My response template:**
```
Hi [Name]! Thanks for reaching out. I can help with [their issue].

I have availability on [Date] at [Time] or [Alternative Time]. 

Does one of those work for you?

- [Your Name]
[Your Business]
[Phone]
```

**Why this works:**
- Fast response shows you care
- Give specific options (not "when are you free?")
- Include contact info in every message

**Confirmation (day before):**
```
Hi [Name]! Confirmed for tomorrow at [Time] for [service]. 
I'll text you 30 minutes before I arrive. See you then!
```

**Morning of (30 min before):**
```
Hi [Name], on my way! Should be there in about 30 minutes.
```

**Results:** Customers already trust you before you show up.

### Phase 2: During the Job

**The First Impression Checklist:**

✅ **Arrive in a clean vehicle**
- Your truck is part of your brand
- Dirty truck = unprofessional in their mind

✅ **Look professional**
- Clean shirt with your logo
- Clean boots
- Professional appearance matters more than you think

✅ **Introduce yourself properly**
- "Hi, I'm [Name] from [Business]"
- Shake hands
- Make eye contact
- Smile

✅ **Protect their home**
- Wear shoe covers or ask to take shoes off
- Use drop cloths
- Act like it's your grandmother's house

**The Walk-Through:**

Before you touch anything:

1. **Listen to the full problem**
   - Don't interrupt
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Take notes

2. **Assess the situation**
   - Explain what you're seeing
   - In language they understand (no jargon)

3. **Present options**
   - Good, better, best pricing
   - Explain pros/cons of each
   - Let them decide (don't pressure)

4. **Get approval before starting**
   - Show the estimate
   - Answer questions
   - Get verbal or written approval

**During the work:**

✅ **Keep the area clean**
- Clean as you go
- Don't leave a mess

✅ **Update them periodically**
- If you find something else: "Hey, I noticed [issue]. Want me to look at it?"
- If it's taking longer: "This is taking a bit longer because [reason]. Still on track to finish by [time]."

✅ **Don't talk on the phone**
- If you need to take a call, step outside
- Give them your full attention

### Phase 3: Completing the Job

**The Final Walkthrough:**

1. **Show them what you did**
   - Walk them through the work
   - Explain what to expect
   - Answer questions

2. **Clean up completely**
   - Cleaner than when you arrived
   - Take all trash with you
   - Do a final sweep

3. **Provide documentation**
   - Invoice with itemized details
   - Warranty information
   - Your contact info for questions

4. **Ask if they're satisfied**
   - "Are you happy with everything?"
   - Address any concerns NOW
   - Don't leave until they're satisfied

**Before you leave:**
```
"Thanks for your business! I sent the invoice to your email. 
If anything comes up or you have questions, call me directly 
at [number]. And if you're happy with the work, I'd really 
appreciate a review. I'll text you a link."
```

---

### Phase 4: After the Job

**Same day:**

Text them the review link:
```
Hi [Name]! Thanks again for your business today. If you're 
happy with the work, would mean a lot if you could leave a 
quick review: [link]

And remember, if you have any questions about the work, 
call me anytime: [phone]
```

**Next day:**

Check-in message (optional but powerful):
```
Hi [Name], just checking in to make sure everything is 
working well with [the work you did]. Any issues, let me know!
```

**30 days later:**

Follow-up for maintenance or related services:
```
Hi [Name], it's been about a month since we [service]. 
Just wanted to check in and see if you need anything else. 
I'm offering [related service] at a discount for existing 
customers this month.
```

## Handling Problems (The Real Test)

Customer service isn't about being perfect. It's about how you handle problems.

### When Something Goes Wrong:

**Step 1: Acknowledge it immediately**
- "You're right, that's not acceptable."
- Don't make excuses
- Don't blame the customer

**Step 2: Take responsibility**
- "That's on me. Here's what I'm going to do to fix it."
- Even if it wasn't entirely your fault

**Step 3: Fix it fast**
- Drop everything and fix the problem
- Don't charge them for the fix
- Go above and beyond

**Step 4: Follow up**
- "Just wanted to make sure [fix] is working perfectly now."
- "Again, I apologize for the inconvenience."

### Example:

**Bad response:**
"I did what you asked. If you wanted something different, you should have been clearer."

**Good response:**
"I can see why you're not happy with this. That's on me for not clarifying exactly what you wanted. Let me come back tomorrow and make this right. No additional charge."

**Result:** Most customers will become your biggest fans after you fix a problem well.

## The "Extra Touch" Moves

These little things separate good service from great service:

1. **Take photos before/after**
   - Show them what was broken
   - Show them what you fixed
   - Helps them understand the value

2. **Leave maintenance tips**
   - Write down simple maintenance steps
   - Prevents future problems
   - Shows you care about long-term satisfaction

3. **Offer a warranty**
   - Even if it's just 30 days
   - Shows confidence in your work
   - Builds trust

4. **Remember personal details**
   - Take notes in customer file
   - "How's your daughter doing at State?"
   - People love to be remembered

5. **Thank you notes (old school)**
   - Handwritten card in the mail
   - Nobody does this anymore
   - You'll stand out

## The Review Strategy

Reviews are the most important marketing tool you have.

**When to ask:**
- Right after the job (when they're happy)
- In person first, then follow up with text link

**How to ask:**
- "If you're happy with the work, would you mind leaving a quick review?"
- Make it easy (send direct link)
- Don't beg, just ask

**My conversion rate:**
- Ask in person + text link: 65% leave reviews
- Just ask in person: 20% leave reviews
- Don't ask: 5% leave reviews

**Pro tip:** [Job Flow Hub](https://creativejobhub.com) can automatically send review requests after you mark jobs complete.

## Common Customer Service Mistakes

**1. Over-promising:**
- Don't say you'll be there at 2pm if you might be late
- Better to under-promise and over-deliver

**2. No-showing:**
- If you're going to be late or can't make it, call IMMEDIATELY
- Don't ghost customers

**3. Surprise charges:**
- Estimate should match invoice (within reason)
- If cost increases, explain why and get approval first

**4. Defensive responses to complaints:**
- Never argue with a customer
- Even if they're wrong, stay professional

**5. Ignoring small issues:**
- Address little concerns before they become big problems
- "I noticed this might be an issue. Mind if I look at it?"
